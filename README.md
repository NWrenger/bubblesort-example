# bubblesort-example
This repo contains examples of the bubblesort algorithm written in rust. This branch is the default bubblesort algorithm with a little bit optimization. In the cocktail-shaked branch you can find a highly optimized version of the bubblesort algorithm, the Cocktailshakersort algorithm, which is in best cases upto 50% faster but in worse cases as fast as the normal bubblesort algorithm.
