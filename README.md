# bubblesort-example
This repo contains an example of the bubblesort algorithm written in rust. This branch is the default bubblesort algorithm with a little bit optimization. In the cocktail-shaked branch you can find a highly optimiyed version of the bubblesort which is in bestcases upto 50% faster but in worse cases as fast as the normal bubblesort algorithm.
